# Super easy cloud chamber

[Cloud chambers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_chamber) are what got me into a carrer in High Energy physics. I've been wanting to make one myself for quite awhile. There are many sets of instructions on the web...

* [Quarknet/Fermilab](http://quarknet.fnal.gov/resources/QN_CloudChamberV1_4.pdf) - they want you to build your own aquarium!
* [Symmetry magazine](http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/january-2015/how-to-build-your-own-particle-detector) has a nice article with a movie and a nice explanation of the differnent tracks you'll see, but lacks specifics (e.g. how big of a fish tank? What lid?)
* [Instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-a-Cloud-Chamber-using-Peltier-Coolers/) has one that uses a Peltier cooler instead of dry ice. Very cool (ha!) but complicated and expensive. You used to be able to buy an assembled chamber from a [company](http://www.nothinglabs.com/electroniccloudchamber/) that is now considering selling kits. 
* [Jefferson Lab](http://education.jlab.org/frost/cloud_chamber.html) has a nice video of making a small cloud chamber. They recommend you buy a radioactive source. Note that their series of science education videos are really great! 

I finally found a video and paper from [IOPScience](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0031-9120/47/3/338/meta) for a plastic fish tank chamber with instructions that were quite detailed. The whole thing looked very easy to put together. The paper is behind a pay-wall (sigh), but below I'll describe the Cloud Chamber my daughter and I built and the parts we used. 

## Parts

* Clear plastic fish tank. I bought [this one](http://www.carolina.com/animal-habitats/clear-view-plastic-aquariumterrarium-medium/674339B.pr?question=) online from Carolina, a biological supply company. Dimensions are 7-1/2" W × 11-1/4" L × 9-1/4" H and it costs a little over $10. It came to my house within a few days of ordering. Amazon doesn't seem to carry a plastic fish tank this size. 
* For the base, I bought this 9x13" small baking pan from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K4TH7TY/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). It cost about $9.50. 
* You need black felt with an adhesive back. I got a sheet from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0054G5XA2/ref=od_aui_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). $4.60.
* Isopropyl alcohol is needed. The kind you buy at the drug store (usually 70%) will have too much water in it. 90% supposedly works, but 99% is best. I got a 16 oz bottle of 99% isopropyl alcohol from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001B5JT8C/ref=od_aui_detailpages01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for $8.70

In principle, the above and some dry ice (see below) is all you need. I got some extra stuff, all from Amazon, that have been helpful,

* A [wash bottle](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005Z4RGQW/ref=od_aui_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) is convenient for squirting the alcohol onto the felt. $5.09
* 2% Thoriated [welding rods](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BKYV9JU/ref=od_aui_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) are a tiny bit radioactive and are a great source to put in the cloud chamber (the IOPScience article/movie uses them). I bought a pack of 10 for $11.49. Not sure what to do with the other nine welding rods. You can't buy just one.
* Blue tack or [poster tack](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BKQDB4/ref=od_aui_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) is great for holding up the welding rod
* Good [gloves](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06Y13FZ45/ref=od_aui_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for handling the dry ice. These are now apparently out of stock.
* The movie/article uses black duct tape. I didn't really need any. 

## Assembly

* The movie/article uses the lid of the fish tank as a snap-in base and they show how to cut a big hole in it. The lid that came with the tank from Carolina was impossible to cut (it melted with a rotary tool and splintered with a saw). We determined that we didn't really need it and discarded the lid.
* Cut the felt into 1 inch wide strips and stick it on the wall, towards the bottom, around the inside of the tank. Note that we'll use the tank upside down, so from now on I'll describe the tank in that configuration -- stick the felt on the wall towards the top of tank. See the ![picture](images/tank.png)
